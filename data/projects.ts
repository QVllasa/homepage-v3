One of my main tasks was developing the communication between the VR environment and the game Factorio. This required a deep understanding of both the VR technology and the game's mechanics, as well as the ability to bridge the two and create a seamless user experience.  In addition to this, I also developed the navigation and camera perspectives within the VR environment. This required a strong sense of spatial awareness, as well as the ability to create intuitive controls that would allow users to easily move around and explore the virtual space.  Lastly, I was also responsible for video editing and modeling tasks for the VR environment. This required an eye for detail and a strong understanding of 3D modeling software. I used these skills to create engaging and realistic virtual spaces that users could explore and interact with.  Overall, my contributions to the Virtual Engineering Internship were significant and I played a key role in the success of the project.",
